# Monke Dimensions

## Installation
First, download the [latest build](https://github.com/Chin0303/Monke-Dimensions/releases/latest) and extract/unzip it.\
 Then navigate to your Plugins folder and drag it into there. If you play on Steam its most likely located at ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Gorilla Tag\BepInEx\plugins``` and if you play on Oculus its most likely located at ```C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\another-axiom-gorilla-tag\BepInEx\plugins```. 

Make sure that both the `Monke Dimensions.dll` and `Dimensions` folder are both in `(GTAG ROOT)\BepInEx\plugins\Monke.Dimensions\`. If you need to, you can create the `Monke.Dimensions` folder and move the files into that.\
If all went according to plan, the mod should now be setup and ready to use!

## Installing Dimensions
In order to add Dimensions, you'll first want to download the maps you want. The easiest way to find maps is to go into the official [Monke Dimensions Discord Server](https://discord.gg/chin-s-server-1041450240135413890) and go into the [dimensions-download](https://discord.com/channels/1041450240135413890/1178592176997941290) channel.

## For Developers

Monke Dimensions allows mod creators to make their own mods for maps.

```csharp
DimensionEvents.OnDimensionEnter += (dimension) =>
{
    if (dimension == "Demo Map, Chin")
    {
        GameObject objectToFind = FindObjectInDimension("object");
        /* Do stuff */
    }
};

DimensionEvents.OnDimensionLeave += (dimension) =>
{
    if (dimension == "Demo Map, Chin")
    {
        /* Undo stuff */
    }
};

```
### Dimension Enter Notes:
- To know if a specific dimension is loaded, you can use the string parameter to check what dimension is loaded.

- The string parameter is formatted as follows: "DimensionName, DimensionAuthor". Not sure what the name or author is of a dimension? You can look at the dimension terminal and see it there, or you can log it as follows: Debug.Log(dimension);

- Use FindObjectInDimension to find an object in the currently loaded dimension.

### Trigger Events
```csharp
DimensionEvents.OnDimensionTriggerEvent += 
(triggerevent, triggerGameobject, triggeredGameObject, ison) =>
{
    if(triggerevent == TriggerEvent.ToggleActiveState)
    {
        /* Get the renderer component of the trigger object */
        var matRenderer = triggerGameobject.GetComponent<Renderer>();
        
        /* If the "isOn" boolean is true, then apply A green color onto the Trigger Object (NOT the object that is getting triggered by the trigger object), if not apply A red color onto it. */
        matRenderer.material.color = ison ? Color.green : Color.red;
    }
};
```
### Trigger Event Notes:
- If you want to check for a Teleport trigger event, just do ```if(triggerevent == TriggerEvent.Teleport)```. The "isOn" boolean will alway be false, due to the Teleport trigger event not being A toggleable event.
