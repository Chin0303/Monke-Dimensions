Monke Dimensions is a mod for Gorilla Tag which lets you travel to custom, player-made maps ingame.

# Requirements
If you're reading this, chances are you have Gorilla Tag on Steam/Rift but note that you'll also need to have [BepInEx](https://docs.bepinex.dev/index.html) installed with the game aswell. The easiest way to do that is with [Monke Mod Manager](https://github.com/BzzzThe18th/MonkeModManager/releases/latest). With BepInEx, you'll also need to install [Utilla](https://github.com/legoandmars/Utilla/releases/latest) aswell. You can also do this from Monke Mod Manager.

# Installation
First, download the [latest build](https://github.com/Chin0303/Monke-Dimensions/releases/latest) and extract it using the tool of your choice. ([7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) is recommended.) Then extract the zip into `(GTAG ROOT)\BepInEx\plugins`. (`(GTAG ROOT)` is the folder that the Gorilla Tag executable is located. On Steam it is found in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Gorilla Tag\`, or alternatively you can right-click the game in your Steam library, and press `Browse local files` in `Manage`.)

Make sure that both the `Monke Dimensions.dll` and `Dimensions` folder are both in `(GTAG ROOT)\BepInEx\plugins\Monke.Dimensions\`. If you need to, you can create the `Monke.Dimensions` folder and move the files into that.
## **If all went according to plan, the mod should now be setup and ready to use!**

# Adding Maps
In order to add maps, you'll first want to download the maps you want. The easiest way to find maps is to go into the official [Monke Dimensions Discord Server](https://discord.gg/chin-s-server-1041450240135413890) and go into the `dimensions-download` channel.
## Maps are stored as `(MAP NAME).dimension`, so if any map you download doesn't have that or a compression format such as `.zip`,</br>**DO NOT OPEN IT! IF YOU GOT IT FROM THE DISCORD, REPORT IT TO A MODERATOR OR SOMEONE HIGHER.**
After downloading the maps you want, all you need to do is move them to the `Dimensions` folder located inside of `Monke.Dimensions`. (If you need a full-link, it's `(GTAG ROOT)\BepInEx\plugins\Monke.Dimensions\Dimensions\`.)
